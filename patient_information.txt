so to being we take the patient information
then we take the inital conditions for what we plan on tracking
then we define a control spec - this tell us how to design our treatment plan 
    policy -> dosing schedule will be learnable 
    closed loop -> we continuously observe patient state
    chanel-> drugs we need to track

then we define our policy
    affine sidmoid -> ensures values are smoothly bounded, doesn't need harcore clippling
    state inputs -> terms we use to define out optimization algorithm

then we deine bounds
    this gives is harcore bounds that prevent extremely toxic treatment to be administered to the patient

then we deine cumulative
    what this does is day that over the entire treatment schedule, the amount of a drug cannot go over this amount for safety reasons

"actuation"
    this defines the days during treatment where we can give treatment and days where we can't in order to let the immune system recovery

"regularization"
    l2_on_u -> dose burden pentalty
    tv_on_u -> u[t]-u[t-1] (smoothness)
    slack_penalty -> weight of the penalty if limits are violated 

optimization
    establishes the goals we want to optimize in out research
